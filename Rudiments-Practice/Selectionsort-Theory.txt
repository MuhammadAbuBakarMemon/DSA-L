How selection sort works is by finding the smallest element in our array and then it swaps it with the element in the first position
then the algorithm figures out the second smallest element in the array and swaps that with the element at the second position 
this carries onn until th eentire array is sorted 

Working Methodology:-

it considers the array as two sub arrays
one sorted and one unsorted 

Outer loop
loops for n - 1 times because if we have sorted n - 1 elements in our array then it is obvious that all n elements have now been sorted

Inner loop starts from m + 1 [1] index position because
we assume that initially the first element is always sorted
we loop until the end of the array looking for the smallest elements index 

once we exit the inner loop swap operation is performed.....
and for refernece or imaginary purposes the size of our sorted array increases by 1 and the unsorted array's size decreases by 1 simultaneously 

this carries on for n - 1 times until we obtain a sorted array////
