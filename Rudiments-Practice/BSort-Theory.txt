okay so we also call the Bubble sort algorithm the sinking sort 

because an ascending version of the particular sorting algorithm basically 
sinks all the smaller elements to the start of the array 
and 
bubble sort because with each pass/iteration completed, we have a guarantee that the larget element is bubbled at the end of our list

The viecersa is what we can consider for a Bubble sort algorithm that sorts everything in a descending order
i.e that operates on the condition 
ray[m] < ray[m + 1];
