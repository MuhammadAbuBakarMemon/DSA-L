// Q5. Create a database with Teacher class to store the teacherâ€™s name, the subject they teach,
// and their years of experience, with the name and subject stored as dynamic strings. First, write
// the class without a copy constructor or assignment operator and observe what happens when
// you copy one teacher object into another (shallow copy problem). Then implement the Rule of
// Three to fix the issue. Display both teacher objects before and after the fix to demonstrate the
// difference.
